                <h1><b>What Is Health Insurance?</b></h1><br>
                Health insurance is a contract between a company and a<br>
                consumer. The company agrees to pay all or some of the<br>
                insured person's healthcare costs in return for<br>
                payment of a monthly premium.

                <h1>How Health Insurance Works</h1>
                In Kenya, health insurance is tricky to navigate. It is a business with a number of regional
                and national competitors whose coverage, pricing, and availability vary from state to state and even by county.
                About half of Americans have health insurance coverage as an employment benefit, with premiums partially covered
                by the employer.
                The cost to the employer is tax-deductible to the payer, and the benefits to the employee are tax-free,
                with certainexceptions for S corporation employees.

                Self-employed people, freelancers, and gig workers can buy insurance directly on their own. The Affordable Care
                Act of 2010, commonly called Obamacare, mandated the creation of a national database, called HealthCare.gov,
                which allows individuals to search for standard plans from private insurers that are available where they live.
                 The costs of the coverage are subsidized for taxpayers whose incomes are below the federal poverty threshold.
